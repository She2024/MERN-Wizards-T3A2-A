## Build plan
We have created this simple build plan to outline the key stages of our development process. It will ensure that we follow a clear and structured approach from the initial stage to deployment. The guide includes important steps such as project initialisation, frontend and backend setup and integration, feature implementation, testing, and optimisation. We will work together through all areas to upskill and gain knowledge in all aspects. By collaborating, we aim to deliver an application that is well-structured and fully functional.

## R1: Project Overview:

### [A Ticket A Task-it product teaser](./docs/Presentation%20/Group%20Project.pdf)

### Description
The platform is a discussion board designed to enable staff or group members to discuss and set workflow priorities. It incorporates user registration and classification to manage permissions for interacting with, deleting, or archiving threads. 

### Purpose
The aim is to facilitate easy collaboration by providing an economical and efficient way for businesses to communicate and plan future workflow priorities. By increasing collaboration without increasing subscription costs, it helps reduce invalid service requests, as staff can better understand which unit manages specific assets or projects. 

### Functionality/Features
The discussion board will support informal conversations across the business to map and prioritise workflows for a 12-month plan while allowing flexibility to accommodate changes. Key features include:
- **Registered User Authentication**: Restricts access to authorised users.
- **User Classifications**: Manages levels of access and permissions.
- **Discussion Topics with Replies**: Users can create and participate in topic discussions.
- **Search Function**: Allows easy location of topics.
- **Priority/Category Labels**: Helps in organising discussions.
- **Notifications**: Alerts users to updates or new topics.
- **Admin Functions**: Includes options to delete, archive, and set priority levels for discussions.
- **JIRA API Link to the Cards(Future application idea)**: Integrate with JIRA via its API, allowing users to link discussion threads directly to JIRA cards. This facilitates a seamless transition between planning and execution phases by maintaining direct access to task details and status updates within the JIRA platform.

### Target Audience
This build is specifically designed for our client, Life Stats, to address their unique communication and workflow challenges. However, the platform is also a versatile tool that can greatly benefit any company or group looking to improve collaboration, streamline workflow planning, and establish open channels for discussion.  

#### Key Stakeholders
- **Project Managers**: To oversee and prioritise project discussions and workflows.
- **Team Leads**: To engage their teams in collaborative discussions and contribute to setting priorities.
- **Staff Members**: To participate in discussions, offer insights, and help in decision-making processes related to workflow priorities.
- **IT Administrators**: To manage user roles and ensure secure and efficient platform usage

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using React.js to provide a dynamic and intuitive user interface.

- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express, featuring:
  - **Schemas**:
    - **postSchema**: Includes title, content, author, creation date, and a reply array.
    - **replySchema**: Comprises content, author, creation date, and links to parent posts.
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `get-all-posts`: Fetches all posts.
    - `get-post-by-ID`: Retrieves specific posts by ID.
    - `create-new-posts`: Allows the creation of new discussions.
    - `create-reply-to-posts`: Facilitates replying to posts.
  - **Replies Management**:
    - Replies are saved to the database and linked to the parent post.
    - Posts with replies are fetched to display full discussions on the frontend.
  - **Error Handling**: Returns meaningful error messages to users when exceptions occur.

- **Database**: Utilises MongoDB to efficiently store and manage data.

- **Hosting**: The application is hosted on Netlify, ensuring reliable availability and scalability.

## R4:	User Stories	
We have developed four personas, each with at least two user stories that capture their needs and interactions with our application. These personas help us understand and address the diverse requirements of our users, ensuring the app's design remains user-centric and effective.

There is a detailed persona below, and follow the links to view all four of our personas:

### Persona: Wade Warren

What? I need a service where I can change the priority of tasks when a task becomes urgent. Why? So critical marketing tasks get completed on time.

What? I need a service where my team and I can reply to submitted requests with additional marketing notes or materials. Why? So the Web Services team has all the necessary assets and information to complete the work.

What? I need a service where I can edit my request after submitting it.
Why? So I can correct mistakes or update details without submitting a new request.

What? I need a service where my requests are securely stored. Why? So I don’t lose important information and can reference past submissions.

What? I need a service where my team can see all submitted requests and their priorities. Why? So everyone knows what tasks are being worked on and which ones are the highest priority.

#### Persona Cards
We have the other Personas outlined on the cards bellow.

## R6:	Screenshots of your Trello (or similar kanban system) board throughout the duration of the project

### Trello Board
Our project utilised Trello as our chosen Kanban system, used in conjunction with our purpose created Mern Wizards group Discord, to implement Agile methodology effectively throughout the project duration. Trello's visual interface allowed us to maintain clear and simple standards for task management and prioritized efficient workflows.

#### Planning Methodology
- **Columns Setup**: Our Trello board was organised into columns representing key stages of development: Design, Up Next, In Progress, Submitted, Building, Testing, Completed, Part B Standby.

#### Agile Implementation
- **Task Cards**: Each task card included detailed descriptions, due dates, assignees, and relevant attachments or links. This level of detail maintained clarity and transparency, ensuring all team members could contribute effectively.

#### Project Progression
- **Screenshots**: Throughout the project, we captured screenshots of our Trello board to document the evolution of our task management. These screenshots demonstrate how the board aided in visualising progress.
