# Colour selection planning

## Colour selection - Creating a calm, modern, and sophisticated look with an undertone of trust. 

Colour interpretation is subjective and while one person may feel empowered and pretty in their best Barbie pink suite, others (like this humble writer) would feel like a clown and a fraud in the same outfit. Despite the subjective nature of colour psychology, there are some generally accepted rules; many of which could be linked to our consumer culture, upbringings and even good old personal preference. These factors make it hard to conclusively quantify how a colour will make a person feel (Ciotti, 2024). 

Blue is widely accepted as a secure and trustworthy colour often associated with companies that allude to being  reliable, such as PayPal and Twitter. While green invokes feelings of tranquillity and growth, a trick used by companies like Suncorp or Land Rover. Shades and tones of the blacks, greys and whites provide a sense of balance and calm creating a neutral space to simply exist. Think YingYang the ultimate symbol of balanced neutrality with equal quantities of black and white or even the humble classic print newspaper a source of ‘truth’ across the ages.  

With this in mind, we planned our colour pallet create a calm, modern and sophisticated look with an undertone of trust. Leading us to selection of greys balanced with black and ivory and a pop of a blue-green delightfully named Robin’s Egg Blue. The colour name further strengthening the feelings of trust and calmness by summoning images of Christopher Robin and Winni the Poo tending to a fragile egg... 

Or more honestly, we just really like the colours and thought others would too. 

    Charcoal (#36454F): For text and main components 
    Slate Gray (#708090): For subtle backgrounds or quieter sections 
    Robin's Egg Blue (#00CCCC): For small pop-out elements or highlights
    Ivory (#FFFFF0): As the main background
    Black(#0A0A0A): Secondary text option 

After finding a selection of blue, grey and white that was aesthetically pleasing, we considered how our colour palette would be view, or not, by clients with impaired vision or colour blindness. We ran our selection through some colour and contrast checkers to ensure that it would have the best accessibility scores for maximum visibility. Web Content Accessibility Guide (WCAG) sets out the standard for colour contrast across a range of text and images to ensure the minimum standard vision of 20/40 is met. 

The Coolors.co website allowed us to enter the RBG indicators for our colours to see how our colour selection would be perceived through by 8 different types of colour blindness. This tool ensured our foreground and background colours would not blend together causing the user to lose sight of the page details or texts.    

 We then confirmed the colour contrast with the ColorKit colour contrast checker to give us a more comprehensive WCAG contrast ratio report. We chose to aim big and made sure that our colour palette passed the highest standard of vision impairment, 20/80 vison. This is one step we have actively taken to ensure usability and inclusivity is well considered in the design of our app.
